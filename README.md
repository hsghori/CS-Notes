# JHU CS Notes

These are notes I've written for courses in the JHU CS Department as a student / TA. 

Certain formatting constructs like tabels, latex math, and images were written using pandoc's enhanved markdown and do not render as intended in Github. You can get a properly formatted PDF of any of these notes by cloning this repo and using pandoc to convert the markdown files to PDFs. 

Usage:
```Bash
$ pandoc -o <filename>.pdf <note-file>.md
```

## Requirements

This requires that you have pandoc and Latexx installed on your system. You can find installation instructions [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
