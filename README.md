# JHU CS Notes

These are notes I've written for CS courses and general software development stuff. 

Some formatting constructs like tabels, latex math, and images were written using pandoc's enhanved markdown and may not be 
rendered as intended in Github. You can get a properly formatted PDF of any of these notes by cloning this repo and using 
pandoc to convert the markdown files to PDFs. 

Usage:
```Bash
$ pandoc -o <filename>.pdf <note-file>.md
```

## Requirements

This requires that you have pandoc and Latexx installed on your system. You can find installation instructions 
[here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
